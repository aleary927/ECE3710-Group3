As the music starts playing, from the 4 lanes on the monitor, white tiles will start falling with a predetermined pattern according to the music.
User is expected to strike the corresponding drum pad when the falling white tile reaches the bottom.
For example, user is expected to strike the first pad, when a white tile falling on the first lane on the monitor, reaches the bottom.
