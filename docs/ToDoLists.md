# To Do Lists 

## Checkpoint 2: 
* Data-path
    * implement module 
        * verify exactly what ports are needed 
        * basically a bunch of muxes
    * testbench to verify module 
        * verify every datapath manipulation
* Memory 
    * ~~testbench to verify module~~
        * ~~test reads and writes of both ports~~
        * ~~test that read and write is syncronous~~
    * FSM for on-board demo 
        * walk through memory addresses and perform simple modifications 
        * re-read location of write to verify that writing works
    * top-level module for on-board demo
        * address on leds 
        * write-data on 7-seg displays 
* Control points list 
    * update with all new identified control points 
* Generate diagram of datapath 
    * can probably grab screenshot of RTL schematic in quartus
* Submit assignment 
    * datapath photo/diagram 
    * control points list 
    * verilog for memory, and for demonstration FSM
