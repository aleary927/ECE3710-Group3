The musical tile project demonstrated the capabilities of FPGA technology in creating an 
engaging rhythm game with real-time input handling and precise timing synchronization. 
It achieved responsive gameplay and accurate note rendering by leveraging custom hardware 
design and low-latency processing, showcasing FPGAs' potential in gaming applications. 
While the core objectives were met, enhancements like multiple
difficulty levels, and a multiplayer mode could further improve the experience. 
Overall, the project highlights the advantages of FPGA technology for 
timing-sensitive applications and demonstrates the potential for its use in gaming 
applications.
