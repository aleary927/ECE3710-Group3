The system achieved smooth synchronization with no evident latency and a flicker-free display of the game elements. Tiles moved at a consistent and adjustable speed, showcasing the precision timing and responsiveness of the FPGA-based design. The display of player scores and tile interactions at the termination timing line behaved as expected. The trigger of drum pads associated with distinct sounds operated well, with no noticeable delay or disruption; this, in conjunction with sufficient audio quality from the music, created an engaging auditory layer that complemented the visual elements of the game. These features demonstrated the system's ability to handle real-time input processing and graphical rendering concurrently. 
While the rhythm tile game demonstrated strong functionality in its final implementation and its core mechanics operated without issue, it was limited to a single level. The absence of additional levels posed no progressive difficulty for players. This limitation was primarily due to time constraints and a focus on ensuring the stability of the primary features, like VGA display synchronization, tile rendering, and drum pad coordination. The lack of extra levels could be remedied by expanding memory options external to the FPGA to support complex display patterns and different songs associated with different levels. 
Overall, the foundational framework of the game is robust and versatile and would be able to support the aforementioned additions.
